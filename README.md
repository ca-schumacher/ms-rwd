Data science project using real world data on multiple sclerosis


# Investigating real world data on multiple sclerosis

Data analysis of real world data on multiple sclerosis.
The data can be found here: https://www.floodlightopen.com/en-US/for-scientists .

**January 2020**

## Introduction

**Project Description:**

I will explore this real world dataset to analyse and predict symptoms of multiple sclerosis:
* Which of the collected metrics show differences between people with multiple sclerosis and controls?
* Can we use the dataset to monitor and track symptomatic progresses?
* Does the mood (or self-reported well-being) correlate with some of the gathered metrics?

**Data Description:** 

The data is published by the Floodlight Open project (https://www.floodlightopen.com/en-US/) by Genentech. It can be downloaded through https://www.floodlightopen.com/en-US/for-scientists . The data is collected by a smartphone app that provides questionnaires and collects sensor data when the user performs certain tasks.
According to the project website, data of the following tests was collected:
* **Mood:** A quick daily question about how you feel
* **Matching Symbols:** Matching symbols to digits measures how quickly you process information
* **Squeeze a Tomato:** This task is designed to measure changes in hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills.
* **Draw a Shape:** Drawing a shape measures the speed and accuracy of hand and finger movements
* **U-Turn:** This task measures how you walk and your ability to change direction
* **2 Min Walk:** Walking quickly for 2 minutes measures your stamina and mobility
* **Balance:** Standing still for 30 seconds measures posture and stability
* **Passive Monitoring:** Gathering information on activity to understand how your health affects your life
